## Penmates<br/>Create international friendships<br/>That last a lifetime

Penmates is an upcoming social platform that allows you to connect with people across the globe. We make it easy to find and chat with people internationally through a platform tailored to making and keeping friends. Our penpal platform is free and easy to use with a beautiful and simple design, making it easy for you to focus on finding likeminded friends. 

#### This repository is the current holding page implementation

You can see the site at [penmates.co](https://penmates.co). This site is built using [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and at the moment features nothing but an input for email, where users can register their email address to keep updated on the projects progress.
